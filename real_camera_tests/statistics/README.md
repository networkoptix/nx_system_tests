# Gather and process statistics for Real Camera Tests (RCT)

## Purpose

This script is intended to collect test reports from several RCT runs from different Mediaserver
versions.

The version with the smallest number is a "reference" - the results gathered from the other runs
will be compared with it.

Script run results are saved to HTML document that contains a table with processed data.

## Usage

Run script with `--help` to see the arguments list with descriptions.
